        customer interactions and team performance to product usage and
        financial efficiency. Our internal metrics dashboard helps you translate
        those raw numbers into meaningful insights. By centralizing operational
        data in real time, your organization can identify patterns, detect
        inefficiencies early, and make confident decisions backed by evidence,
        not assumptions.
